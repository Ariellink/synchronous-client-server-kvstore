## how logging works in Rust?
log crate: (https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/)  
env_logger: (https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.10.0/env_logger/index.html)

A log request consists of a *target*, a *level*, and a *body*.
### how logging works in Rustï¼Ÿ

#### Logging facade:  ->`log crate` (only provides logging apis)  
-> libs (such as `env_logger`) to impl these logging apis in their logging impplementations(namely `logger`)   
-> users choose these logging libs for their use case (https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/#available-logging-implementations) or write their own loggers (https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/#implementing-a-logger)

### Usage
five logging macros: `error!`, `warn!`, `info!`, `debug!` and `trace!`.

log crate exposes the logging facade. 

`Log` trait source code:
```rust
/// A trait encapsulating the operations required of a logger.
pub trait Log: Sync + Send {
    /// Determines if a log message with the specified metadata would be
    /// logged.
    ///
    /// This is used by the `log_enabled!` macro to allow callers to avoid
    /// expensive computation of log message arguments if the message would be
    /// discarded anyway.
    ///
    /// # For implementors
    ///
    /// This method isn't called automatically by the `log!` macros.
    /// It's up to an implementation of the `Log` trait to call `enabled` in its own
    /// `log` method implementation to guarantee that filtering is applied.
    fn enabled(&self, metadata: &Metadata) -> bool;

    /// Logs the `Record`.
    ///
    /// # For implementors
    ///
    /// Note that `enabled` is *not* necessarily called before this method.
    /// Implementations of `log` should perform all necessary filtering
    /// internally.
    fn log(&self, record: &Record);

    /// Flushes any buffered records.
    fn flush(&self);
}

```

#### Logger
In order to produce log output executables have to use a logger implementation compatible with the facade.   
Loggers implement the `Log` trait.  

There are many available implementations to choose from logger can be configured via environment variables

##### Available logger

env_logger | simple_logger | simplelog | ...  


`env_logger` writes logs to stderrï¼ˆé»˜è®¤æƒ…å†µä¸‹ï¼‰, you can configure it to write the log to stdout.
Log level is configured by environment variables. By default all logging is disabled except for the error level.

### å¦‚ä½•æž„é€ ä¸€ä¸ªenv_logger::Loggerå®žä¾‹ï¼Ÿ
- ðŸš©`Struct env_logger::Logger`: impl `Log` trait from the log crate, which allows it to act as a logger. The `init(), try_init(), Builder::init() and Builder::try_init()` methods will each construct a Logger and immediately initialize it as the default global logger.
- `Function env_logger::init`: Initializes the global logger with an env logger.   
- `Struct env_logger::Builder`: It can be used to customize the log format, change the environment variable used to provide the logging directives and also set the default log level filter.

```Rust
use log::{debug, error, log_enabled, info, Level};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();

    debug!("this is a debug {}", "message");
    error!("this is printed by default");

    if log_enabled!(Level::Info) {
        let x = 3 * 4; // expensive computation
        info!("the answer was: {}", x);
    }
}

// cmd: RUST_LOG=error ./target/debug/log_api (default)
// cmd: RUST_LOG=info cargo run (execute line 11 - 14)
// cmd: RUST_LOG=info ./target/debug/log_api (execute line 11 - 14)
// cmd: RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/log_api (execute all lines, including error and info)
```

```toml
[dependencies]
log = "0.4.17"
env_logger = "0.10.0"
```
Logging is controlled via the `RUST_LOG` environment variableã€‚

output:
```sh
âžœ RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/log_api
[2023-02-26T03:34:30Z DEBUG log_api] this is a debug message
[2023-02-26T03:34:30Z ERROR log_api] this is printed by default
[2023-02-26T03:34:30Z INFO  log_api] the answer was: 12
